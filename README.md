# portfolio
 
At the moment, the portfolio is in active development, but you can already use it as a basis for yourself. In the project one library has been used so far - asajs (my own development https://github.com/RemXYZ/AsaJS), but in the future there will be more uses ...
The portfolio level is very simple, you just need to know scss, php and vanilla js.
